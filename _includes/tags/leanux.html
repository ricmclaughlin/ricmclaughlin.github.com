I love manifestos. And the any manifesto that goes like this has my love:
<ul>
<li>Early customer validation over releasing products with unknown end-user value</li>
<li>Collaborative design over designing on an island</li>
<li>Solving user problems over designing the next “cool” feature</li>
<li>Measuring KPIs over undefined success metrics</li>
<li>Applying appropriate tools over following a rigid plan</li>
<li>Nimble design over heavy wireframes, comps or specs</li>
</ul>
