Back in the day, we just called it configuration management. Or the build system. These days they add in a bit of software defined infrastructure and it is a whole new thing. Not in my book, but whatever. There is not doubt it is useful and important and tools like travis and gulp and the ever present git make it a straightforward affair. And I still love writing scripts that automate the whole thing!
