I don't remember learning HTML... I do remember doing "view source" a lot about 1995. Nor do I remember learning CSS. All that changed when I had to teach it. And after doing that lots and lots of time, and doing lots of code reviews, I can say that I know it and can even appreciate well crafted CSS.
