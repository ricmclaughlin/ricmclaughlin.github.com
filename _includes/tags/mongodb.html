<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> - it's the database for giant ideas. And I buy that. If your app needs to access gianormous amounts of data in a read optimized way or if some amount of data staleness is ok, I'd be all over Mongo to solve that problem. And this from the guy that was the business owner for a data warehouse so my standards are pretty high. What about MongoDB for transactional systems? nope.
