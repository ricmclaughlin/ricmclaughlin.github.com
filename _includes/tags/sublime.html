<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> is marketed as "a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose," and although I haven't written much prose with Sublime, I appreciate its blazing speed, multi-platform support and amazing plugin infrastructure. Lots of times I wish it had auto-complete but other times I love the speed so much I can't think about using something else.
