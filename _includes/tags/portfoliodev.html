"Github Pages Portfolio Development with Jekyll, Yeoman and Gulp.js" is a three evening class where budding developers create their own portfolio website while learning the basics of Git, Github, Bash shell, the Ruby Tool Chain (rvm, gem and rake), Jekyll, Markdown, the Node.js Tool chain (nvm, node and npm), as well as how to scaffold using Yeoman then a bit about Gulp.js and the gulp-gh-pages plugin. This is a hands on, intensive class using the c9 online development environment. Folks get a lot of out this class and the metrics keep getting better each time I teach it!
