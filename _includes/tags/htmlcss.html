HTML5 &amp; CSS3 are the bedrocks of web development. You just aren't going anywhere without strong knowledge of these technologies. For me, seeing that I have been doing HTML dev for... well, a long time, and learned it before they had books to learn it, I have struggled keeping up with the kids that sling HTML &amp; for a living. No longer. I've done tons of practice in this area. And now I can say it: I rock at HTML &amp; CSS!
