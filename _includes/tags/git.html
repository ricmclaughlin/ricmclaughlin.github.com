Git is ubiquitous. Everyone uses it. And like most, folks I do too. I've gone though numerous classes, used it alot during my personal development projects and during open source collaboration and even developed and taught a series of classes on its use to create an online portfolio on gh-pages to the Free Code Campers in Ballard.
