Test Driven Development (TDD) is a way of life. It makes you implement only what is required and no more. It adds to the robustness of your app by testing it everytime you build. It provides built in, always current documentation. The only downside is that it takes time during the initial implementation - yet saves so much time during maintenance. Just frickin' do it and quit your yapping.
