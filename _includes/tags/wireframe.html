In the past wireframes have been a big deliverable in the march from idea to final product. The only problem is that most times a wireframe serves its purpose to drive requirements into UI to only be thrown away once it gets completed. I've seen so much work wasted and kept asking myself, why not make the wireframe a first, low-fidelity version of the app NOT a throw away deliverable? Using <a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, Sublime Text and lo-fi-ui, I'm working on making that a reality. At least for my teams.
