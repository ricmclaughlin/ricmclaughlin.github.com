Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine which, when translated into English loosely means, "rocks greatly." Add in Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, which is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world, with transpiler support that brings advanced features to the party, with the ability for coding in a single language to run from the UI to the DB and you end up with the very best development language there is. I can write productively in almost any language but I choose <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>. And I like it.
