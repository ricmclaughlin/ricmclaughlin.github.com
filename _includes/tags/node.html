Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine which translated into English means, "rocks greatly." Add in Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, which is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world and you have a rich eco-system of software all in the most dorktastic of development languages: JavaScript. That said, I do node.js. And I like it.
