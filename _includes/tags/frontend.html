<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> frameworks are my tools of choice for front end development. I've spent quality time with good ole Javascript and jQuery, but seeing that one can only write so much code a day, why not get a little higher level of abstraction and get more done? That's why I'm all about Angular.
