What if there was a caching service that scaled elastically? What would you call it? CacheElastic? Nope that sounds odd with the adjective AFTER the noun. How about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/">ElastiCache</a>? Yep, that sounds good. Even better, ElastiCache supports Memecached for the easy stuff and Redis for all the complicated stuff. Cool.
