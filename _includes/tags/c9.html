<a href="">Cloud 9</a> is the best step for a new web dev after coding in a browser and taking lots of online classes. The ability to directly clone a github repo into a workspace, use an excellent editor and a bash shell for a starting price of free is a great deal. I prefer to teach folks when they are using C9 because I am sure that if it works on my C9 workspace it will work on their C9 workspace.
