This course is a great example of why I love about curriculum development. Start with a simple problem... task automation from the command line. Present the basic skills hands on. Bring in higher order thinking by talking about the merits and challenges with approach. Iterate then present more complicated use cases. By the end, the student knows a new library, a new development workflow, and a couple of new data structures. Super fun course!
