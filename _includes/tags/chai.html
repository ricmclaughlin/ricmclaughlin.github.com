<a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework. I love the ability to go TDD or BDD style with this library. Solid support for <a href="http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/">asserts</a>, expect and should syntax.
