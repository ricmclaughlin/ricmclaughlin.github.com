<a href="https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/">Protractor</a> is an end-to-end test framework for AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would. It tests like a user, automatically waits, and is designed specifically for Angularjs apps so it takes advantage of built-in hooks within the framework.
