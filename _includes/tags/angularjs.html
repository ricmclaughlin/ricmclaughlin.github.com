<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> rocks. It's not currently the hotness that it was but it is solid, useful, and relatively easy to implement on project large and small. Of all the technical things I do these days, Angular is my favorite. Add it to a richly developed toolchain and bam you have a single page app. Good stuff.
