<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> rocks. It's not the hotness that it was, but it is solid, useful, and relatively easy to implement on projects large and small. Of all the technical things I do these days, Angular is my favorite. Add Angular to a richly developed toolchain using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> and friends, and bam, you have a single page app. Good stuff.
