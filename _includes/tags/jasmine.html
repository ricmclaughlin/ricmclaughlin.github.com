<a href="http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html">Jasmine</a> is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests. Super easy to use and fast!
