For one, Kanban is NOT an Agile tool, framework or methodology—in fact it’s not even derived from software development practices. Instead, Kanban came out of lean manufacturing techniques made famous by Japanese automakers who used it to manage their workloads. It is so silly simple that it makes me smile. Bottom Line: good stuff... kanban is.
