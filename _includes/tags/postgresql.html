Lots of folks aren't into SQL anymore. Why waste time worrying about a schema when it is just going to change? Why worry about transactions when the fidelity of the data isn't that important seeing that we have SO much of it? That isn't me. My bar for creating a database transaction is low. I like joins. Not so into connection string but ALL databases require that. The bottom line is simple: use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a> for most every app. Except when it gets really, really big.
