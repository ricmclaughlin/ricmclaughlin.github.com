<a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> is a plugin for most text editors that make HTML &amp; CSS development much, much quicker. It's like a meta language really. Very handy. 
And it is included in the c9 editor!... hum, I could write a class that teaches the basics of Emmet on C9! People would love that!
