    <h3 class="media-heading">AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional</h3>
    <p>Solutions Architecture Professional is a simple moniker for know the mile-wide breadth of the AWS product offering deep enough to name the parts, fit the pieces together, explain how the pieces should fit together, optimize how the pieces might fit together then answer detailed product capability questions about all the pieces. And just because the exam is less VPC focused and more AWS Organizations and security focused does not mean the exam got easier - this remains the most difficult certification exam around. I've held this certification since 2017, most recently re-certifying in 2023.</p>
