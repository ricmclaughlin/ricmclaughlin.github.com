      <p>There is a reason the <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp">Project Management Professional</a> is THE project management certification. It's comprehensive. The <a href="https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok">Project Management Book of Knowledge</a> is a tome of processes and tools for PM. Add in the 4500 hours of required project management professional work and the most difficult exam I've taken and you end up with a certification that is worth the effort. I earned the <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/40a5a309-402d-4f5e-a13e-93c6d7a47e8e/public_url">PMP certification</a> on June 10, 2007 and I've renewed it through 2026. </p>
