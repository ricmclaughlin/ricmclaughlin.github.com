Backend development does not have sizzle of front end work, yet node is what makes <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_JavaScript#Server-side_JavaScript">Universal Javascript</a> makes it the place be. I've spent quality time with both <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Expressjs</a> and <a href="http://sailsjs.org/">Sails.js</a> frameworks and they both well. But I hear that express is dying? Document databases like <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> have thier place but these days my DB of choice is still <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgresSQL</a>.
