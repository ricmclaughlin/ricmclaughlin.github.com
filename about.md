So what is a Full Stack Solopreneur? Let's break it down and figure it out.

Full Stack - A while ago lots of Agile PM folks called the ideal person in development team a "generalist." Someone who could do some of all tasks on the project. For a modern development team, this means they knew front end development, some sort of web development tool set, database modeling and some systems administration. And because the term "generalist" is about as exciting Chevy rent-a-car they came up with a new name "full stack developer"
But the term generalist and full stack developer aren't exactly the same. Full stack developer can also create a non-trival application by themselves. That does seem a lot more valuable than a "generalist"
A Solopreneur is a more straight forward term. It means "a entrepreneur"
