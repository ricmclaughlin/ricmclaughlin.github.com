<p>I'm a full-stack web developer focused on the Mongo/Express/Angular/Node Stack. </p>

<p>True, I've run tons of projects and even a hold the <a href="http://www.pmi.org/certification/project-management-professional-pmp.aspx">PMP</a> and <a href="http://www.pmi.org/certification/agile-management-acp.aspx">PMP-ACP</a> certifications, and true, I've managed quite a few groups of people, and true, I've taught lots of <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#classes-ref">web development classes</a> to folks that are hungry to better themselves, and true, I've been a home schooling stay-at-home dad...</p>

<p>yet... building rock solid web apps is what floats my boat. That's what I do.</p>

<p>Which means that, yes, I can talk to a customer and sketch up some super-slick, mighty-useful UX at a whiteboard. And yes, that means I can code up the tight <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#htmlcss-ref">HTML</a>, <a href="">CSS</a>, <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#angularjs-ref">Angular.js</a>, <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#express-ref">Node/Express</a>, and <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#mongodb-ref">MongoDB</a> parts <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#tdd-ref">TDD-style</a> like the cool kids do. And yes, I can even deploy all that goodness using nifty <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#devops-ci-ref">DevOps</a> tools like <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#gulp-ref">gulp.js</a> and <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio#travis-ref">Travis</a> and scale it on AWS.</p>

<p>And yes, you could just take my word for it... or, you can draw your own conclusion by reviewing <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio">my portfolio.</a></p>
