  <p>I'm an AWS centric application architect that codes, teaches and leads teams. My professional qualifications include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Roles as a developer, manager, director, and executive in 4 different public software companies and numerous startups in research and development, consulting services, marketing, sales, e-commerce, and IT</li>
  <li>AWS expertise from over nine years of experience with AWS and 4 AWS Certifications including all three associate level certifications and <a href="/certification?t=aws-dev-ops-pro">AWS DevOps Engineer Professional</a>. I'm also an <a href={{ BASE_PATH }}"/certification?t=aws-academy">AWS Academy Accredited Instuctor</a> for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awsacademy/cloud-computing-architecture/">AWS Academy Cloud Computing Architecture</a></li>
  <li>Program manager expertise with over 6000 documented project management hours and over 25 successful software projects, with both the <a href="/certification?t=pmp">Project Management Professional - PMP</a> and  <a href="/certification?t=pmi-acp">PMI - Agile Certified Practioner - PMI-ACP</a> certifications</li>
  <li>Full stack web application developer skills with applications delivered on the LAMP, MEAN and C#/MS SQL stacks</li>
</ul>
 
  <p>I work on a freelance basis with two types of clients. Over the long haul, for most clients I've developed applications that solve business problems. And the applications are rarely the same. Could be a web app to process special orders, product transfers, and warranty claims using C#, .net and MS SQL Server. Could be a hyper-local SaaS product using the MEAN stack on AWS. Could be a website management system to build, test and deploy 1000s of websites using Travis, S3, and Jekyll. What ever the client needs, I figure it out and deliver it by myself or with team I draw together.</p>

  <p>Over the last couple of years, I've had more and more Ed Tech clients which is a direct offshoot of the joy of teaching I found while my time as a home schooling stay-at-home dad... At first, I did it for free teaching a series of free of <a href={{ BASE_PATH }}"/portfolio?t=curriculum-dev&c=portfolio-dev">portfolio development classes</a> to Seattle based Free Code Campers, then when pro with a brief stint with Galvanize then Level Education and Northeastern University.</p>

 
<p>And yes, you could just take my word for all of this... or, you can draw your own conclusion by reviewing <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/portfolio">my portfolio.</a></p>
