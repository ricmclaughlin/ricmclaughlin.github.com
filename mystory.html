  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I build apps. and features. Using <a href="/process">Ric-ified Lean UX</a>.</p>
  <h2>I don't get it. Why do you like apps?</h2>
  <p>Simple. When I look around I don't see problems; I see puzzles. And apps, if done right, solve puzzles. And I gotta solve the puzzle.</p>
  <h2>That's odd. Why must you "gotta solve the puzzle"?</h2>
  <p><i>[me looking down, lightly embarrased]</i> um, cause it's fun I guess.</p>
  <h2>So what does "gotta solve the puzzle" have to do with Lean UX?</h2>
  <p>More than you would think. LeanUX gets you to solving the problem in an amazing way. </p>
  <p>When the amazingly powerful <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Startup Methodology</a> is applied to UX something amazing happens: apps are imbued with exactly the right quality. And I don't mean the <i>quality</i> that means "bug free"; I mean the <i>quality</i> that means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)">"fitness for purpose"</a>.</p>
  <p>The best way to make an app that is fit for its purpose is to iterate from building the solution, testing the solution, and revising the solution as possible until you run out of time. Each iteration brings you closer to knowing, not guessing, you have are solving the puzzle.</p>
  <h2>Ok. But how did you get here?</h2>
  <p>After Business School ended, I <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/softwarehouse.jpg">sold computers</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA#History">Soft Warehouse</a>, a small shop that later became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA">CompUSA</a>, back you needed to go to the store to buy stuff.</p>
  <p>Then somehow I got hired at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act!_CRM#History">Contact Software</a>, probably because I sold a ton of ACT! at Soft Warehouse and I had once seen a mac, where I <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/act.jpg">found bugs</a> in ACT! DOS V1.1. After <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SYMANTEC+ACQUIRES+CONTACT+SOFTWARE+INTERNATIONAL%3B+ESTABLISHES+CONTACT...-a013148513">we got bought</a> by Symantec and I started developing and <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/symantecscm.jpg">built ACT!</a> for Windows, and ACT! for Mac and ACT! for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_95LX">HP 95LX</a>, and even <a href="http://http://www.symantec.com/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=19960108_03">ACT!</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform">Apple Newton</a>). Then I got promoted and <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/symanteccoretech.jpg">ran a dev group</a> at Symantec. The ACT! product is still around... except it is <a href="http://www.act.com/">act!</a> now.</p>
  <p>After a move to Austin, I tried to get some <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/smartdec.jpg">development</a> going but ended up I growing a couple of random guys into a really <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/smartconsult.jpg">big consulting group</a> at <a href="http://smartdna.com/">SMART Technologies</a>. No, not that <a href="https://smarttech.com/Home+Page/Landing+Page">SMART technologies</a>. The one that got <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/i2-nabs-smart-technologies/smart">acquired by i2</a>.</p>
  <h2>That seems rational. What happened then?</h2>
  <p>I went all irrational. I <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/idot.png">built a team</a> to build a configure-to-order computer e-commerce site... called <a href="http://idot.com/">idot.com</a> in <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1999/10/18/focus5.html">Dell's shadow</a>. The site was <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idotcom-wins-accolades-for-ultra-cool-shopping-site-78043117.html">award winning</a> so we totally were going to get big, right! Nope, we went broke. And I didn't make a cent when they <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1999/12/06/story8.html">acquired</a>  the website.</p><p>After that, even as the Internet bubble was inflating, I had to party like it was 1999, cause it was, and I had a great name for a new company: <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/hcbuscard.png">Holistic Commerce</a>. So I made a neat little <a href="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/hclogo.png">brand</a> and started raising money. But the whole thing turned into a walking, breathing, <a href="http://blog.simeonov.com/startup-anti-patterns/">Lean startup anti-pattern (#35)</a>. Thankfully, when the time came to take the money, I didn't.</p>
  <h2>That sound irrational all right. Did the irrationality continue?</h2>
  <p>No, it didn't. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">bubble popped</a>, I found shelter and smooshed the web development, Internet marketing and customer data warehouse of several <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/mission-critical-and-netiq-merge-in-1-42-billion-deal/">new merged companies</a> (<a href="http://www.webtrends.com/">Webtrends</a>, <a href="https://www.netiq.com/">NetIQ</a> and <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/mission-critical-software-inc-7686-4447">Mission Critical</a>) into a functioning team. It actually worked.</p><p>But that was all too easy. I needed something harder. Perhaps I should get married, quit my job and be a stay-at-home-dad. No, that isn't hard enough, I should be a <a href="http://www.bavarianintlprep.com">homeschooling stay-at-home-dad</a> and move all over the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ric.mclaughlin1/map">world</a>.</p>
  <h2>So what are you doing now?</h2>
  I'm a student of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/ricmclaughlin">sorts</a>... looking for what is next.</p>
