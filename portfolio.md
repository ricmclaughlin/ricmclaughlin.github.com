# Walk Throughs
I learn a lot by coding along while watching videos and reading books. This process really cements the knowledge. And I've done quite a few video series and books...

## Emmet
I wrote a blog post about this [mini-course](https://www.udemy.com/emmet-video-tutorials/) for the best productivity enhancing editor plugin ever. [Faster HTML & CSS workflow with Emmet + Bootstrap](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/prj_html5_emmet/)

## AngularJS
The book that covers the aspects of AngularJS that I find most critical is [AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps](http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured-ebook/dp/B00NF07FSC) by Shyam Seshadri & Brad Green. I really like the emphasis on testing, structure and the clear instruction they have going on. Doesn't use yo/grunt/bower but that is easy to [figure out](http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html). My walkthrough of [AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/ngup_n_running/) includes notes and as much of the code as could be fit in. 

## Projects in HTML5
Tons of projects in the Udemy [Projects in HTML5](https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-html5/learn/#/) course. Tons of cheese in there too... bad code formatting. Bad Boston accent. Clearly the instructor is a reformed php hack. But hey, we all come from somewhere.
