# My Projects

## Learning AngularJS by making a website out of a book
In the interest of making a website out of a book I didn't write and don't want to exactly copy, I did all the exercises in the best AngularJS book I could find  [AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps](http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured-ebook/dp/B00NF07FSC) by Shyam Seshadri & Brad Green. I really like the emphasis on testing, structure and the clear instruction they have going on. Doesn't use yo/grunt/bower but that is easy to [figure out](http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html). My walkthrough of [AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/ngup_n_running/) includes notes and as much of the code as could be fit in. I did this project with the yeoman [angular/grunt](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) generator.  

##TDD with AngularJS
This project was the first one I have done with TDD. Nothing amazing but a good look into the logistics of getting a complete TDD stack going. Includes a bunch of TDD tools including [chai](http://chaijs.com/), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) and [instanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/). Lots of learning on this [project](https://github.com/ricmclaughlin/ang_tdd)

##Rapid Wireframing with Emmet, Bootstrap and Bootsketch
I'm not a fan of dead end deliverables... so making a low fidelity wireframe that turns into the real website is of huge interest to me. To that end I am working on making a rapid wireframing toolbox using 
[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [emmet](http://emmet.io/) (the best html/css tool ever),  [bootsketch](http://yago.github.io/Bootsketch/) (an low fidelity bootstrap theme designed for wireframes) and a bunch of snippets that will make it all faster than you thought possible. Still working on this one [uibootstrap](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/uibootstrap/#/)

## Emmet
I wrote a blog post about this [mini-course](https://www.udemy.com/emmet-video-tutorials/) for the best productivity enhancing editor plugin ever.  Please take this free course now! [Faster HTML & CSS workflow with Emmet + Bootstrap](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/prj_html5_emmet/)

# Walk Throughs
I learn a lot by coding along while watching videos and reading books. This process really cements the knowledge for me. And I've done quite a few video series and books.. But it isn't like these project come directly from the source material... I've modified and changed and improved every single project. Your results will vary.

## Projects in HTML5
Tons of projects in the Udemy [Projects in HTML5](https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-html5/learn/#/) course. Tons of cheese in there too... bad code formatting. Bad Boston accent. Clearly the instructor is a reformed php hack. But hey, we all come from somewhere.

## Projects in Bootstrap
Tons of projects in the Udemy [Projects in HTML5](https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-html5/learn/#/) course. Simply a great review of Bootstrap - a bit tedious at times.

## Projects in AngularJS
Just because I could not get enough of Brad Traversy I also have done quite a few Angularjs walkthrough videos.
