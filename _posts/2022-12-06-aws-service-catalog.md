# Service Catalog
Service Catalog enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services including AMI, servers, software, databases, and complete architectures. Think golden path in CloudFormation.

Catalog administrators (administrators) can manage the catalog of products into portfolios and grant access to end users. Users can access these products and deploy them. Can also integrate with ServiceNow.
