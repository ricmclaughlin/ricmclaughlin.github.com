Now that I have spent time getting it all back together, homeschooling my kids, going on Fall vacation, the first ski trip of the new season and sending my wife to acupuncture school, I’m starting down my new and improved path.[Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/). Lots of reasons to go down this path. I’m working on post that explains the why and more importantly the how of this path.But I wanted to share my [first progress](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/projects/first_ang/index.html). Just a simple app and a few simple tests that I scaffolded with [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) will get me rolling.
