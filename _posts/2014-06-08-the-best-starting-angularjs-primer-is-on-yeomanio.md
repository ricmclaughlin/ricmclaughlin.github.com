The first struggle with [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), and most web app things it seems, is what parts go where in the project. So I figure that this is a good place to start. Perhaps that is the configuration-management build-guy deep within me talking. Anyways.

So I started looking into the three wonder twins of this space: [yeoman](http://yeoman.io), [grunt](http://http://gruntjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/).

Not only did I find great tools that help automate, control and generally buff up an angular.js app... I found a great primer on [Angular.js disguised as a yeoman walkthrough](http://http://yeoman.io/codelab.html)!

It is short, sweet and includes all the right parts including environment setup, little chunks of Angular and even some testing. 

I worked through it and I got it. Both the three wonder twins and Angular. Recommended.
