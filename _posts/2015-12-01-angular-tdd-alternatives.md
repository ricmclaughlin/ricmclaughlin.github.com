<h2 id="tdd-with-angularjs">TDD with AngularJS</h2>
<p>This project was the first one I have done with TDD. Nothing amazing but a good look into the logistics of getting a complete TDD stack going. Includes a bunch of TDD tools including <a href="http://chaijs.com/">chai</a>, <a href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a>, <a href="https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/">protractor</a> and <a href="https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/">instanbul</a>. Lots of learning on this <a href="https://github.com/ricmclaughlin/ang_tdd">project</a>.</p>
