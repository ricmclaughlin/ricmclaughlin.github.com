A while back, I had the hankering to learn more about rspec. 

My motivation was simple: I wanted to stay away from gerkin. Far away from it. But is another story.

And I randomly found a great deal for a 6 month subscription for CodeSchool and they had a rspec class and a ton of other geektastic courses too… And normally I won’t spend money on something like this but… well. I was weak and just bought it.

ok. So I just deleted a lot of ranting about the funky qualities of the  Codeschool courses. Let me take a step back from the flamethrower and just list the good and bad of Codeschool.

The Good:

1. Code in a browser - seeing that installation and configuration of anything is a huge deal for most folks starting with a new technology, coding in a browser is a huge good thing about Codeschool.
2. Catchy tunes - Each course has a little catchy tune that will get stuck in your head if listen to it enough… perhaps this designed to perk you up a bit between learning sessions? But a 30 second intro to 4 minutes of content is a bit excessive in my book.
3. Lots of course variety for the Full Stack learner - This is what really got me excited about code school to begin with. They have courses on Ember.js, Angular.js, Web Design, tons of rails and ruby classes - just about everything a geeky learner would want. They even cover git and sass and jquery and the list goes on. 
4.  Strong membership/account functions - overall the site’s account management is pretty good. After spending a lot of time with these functions for my kid’s learning sites, it was one of the better ones around.
5. It can be had for cheap but not free.

The Bad:

1. The learning curve from the courses to real world is steep - I saw a lot of really great techniques and ideas on how to do testing and code structure and other useful stuff in each course I took… but it was really, really hard to adapt this into the big picture in one of my apps. When you code along with a class outside of the browser you end up with tons of experience solving problems you just don’t get outside of the browser.
2. Often Down-Right Confusing - More than once, I came away not having a single clue how to solve the coding challenges after the material was presented. One case of this stands out for me - in “Ruby Bit 2” class starts with a 10 minute discussion of Lambda and Procs. This is a very confusing topic at best. And even though I really do get it, watching the video on the topic sent me into a “what the hell?” tail spin for a day.
3. A mile wide and ½ inch deep - Each class covers too much width (number of topics) but doesn’t cover enough depth. What good is knowing something exists if you can’t place it in context of other approaches or use it?? This was the most common issue I had with these courses.

Sure coding in a browser is cook but your time is better spent elsewhere. There are tons of other coding in a browser sites that are [free]( http://www.programmr.com/ "Title"), [free](http://www.codecademy.com/ "Title"), [free](http://rubymonk.com/ "Title" )!
