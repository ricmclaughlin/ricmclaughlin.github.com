AWS [OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/opensearch-service/) is for interactive log analytics, real-time application monitoring, website search. OpenSearch is an open source, distributed search and analytics suite forked from Elasticsearch. OpenSearch Dashboards is a fork of Kibana. Like the ELK stack, OpenSearch is great for log analysis, real time application monitoring, full text search, click-stream analysis, and indexing. OpenSearch is not a serverless offering. Use OpenSearch, OpenSearch Dashboards, and Logstash Agent for ELK stack use cases.
