I've been involved with the Free Code Camp group here in Seattle for the last several months and I have gotten so much from the energy and enthuisasm from it.

In the midst of that enthuisasm I have noticed that FCC, and almost no one I can find, teaches folks how to make an online portfolio and certainly not using [jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/). Combined with the troubles lots of folks have taking coding skill they have learned in a browser and applying them to the desktop you have the makings of a great class.

This is my opportunity to give back to the group. To share what I know with the those that have shared with me!

The first session covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to the importance of an <a href="http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1#/4">online portfolio</a>

2. Introduction to <a href="http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1#/6">git and github</a>

3. Git client installation &amp; configuration

4. Features and functions of git including <a href="http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1#/16">branches &amp; commits</a>.

5. Git hub profile and a <a href="http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1#/20">personal gh-pages</a> website

6. <a href="http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1#/24">Gh-pages for projects</a>
