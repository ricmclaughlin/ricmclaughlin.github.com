The focus of the second session of the Github Pages Portfolio Course is the installation of a ruby based tool chain, and the implementation of Jekyll for a portfolio website including blog posts and portfolio projects. This is a meaty class that is entirely hands on. By the end of the session, students have a great understanding of the ends and outs of Jekyll and have a fully functional github portfolio - just without projects that should be hosted in github. And we add those in session #3!

Topics in this class include: 

2. [Jekyll - the big picture](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio2-6-9#/2) - How Jekyll will help us manage our portfolio, blog and website.

3. [Github portfolio creation](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio2-6-9#/6) - How to create a personal website on github, clone the [jekyll starter project](https://github.com/ricmclaughlin/jekyll-bootstrap-3) and use `git remote`
