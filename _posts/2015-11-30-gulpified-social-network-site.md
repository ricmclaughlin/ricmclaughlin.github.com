This project is a walk through of the Socal Media Template chapter of [Udemy's Projects in Bootstrap](https://www.udemy.com/learn-bootstrap-development-by-building-10-projects/learn/#/). 

This project was supposed to be created using non-tooled starter template but I used the [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) generator via [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and lots of [Bower]() packages.

Not too much amazing about this project. It does use the obiquitous [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) sass with [Ruby Compass](http://compass-style.org/). I also implemented [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) syntax transpiled with babel and a slightly outdated [lightbox jQuery plugin] (http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/) and the ever-nifty [Bootstrap tooltip](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips).

This project is part of my [portfolio](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/prj_btstrp_dobble).
