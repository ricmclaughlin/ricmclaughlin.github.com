There is a new version of this class here: [Github Pages Portfolio Development Course with Jekyll, Yeoman and Gulpjs v1.5]({{ BASE_PATH }}/projects/gh-pages-portfolio-with-jekyllv1.5)

The focus of the second session of the Github Pages Portfolio Course is the installation of a ruby based tool chain, and the implementation of Jekyll for a portfolio website including blog posts and portfolio projects. This is a meaty class that is entirely hands on. By the end of the session, students have a great understanding of the ends and outs of Jekyll and have a fully functional github portfolio - just without projects that should be hosted in github. And we add those in session #3!

Topics in this class include: 

1. [Retrospectives on Session #1](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio2#/1) - What's good and what's needs improvement. 

2. [Jekyll - the big picture](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio2#/5) - How Jekyll will help us manage our portfolio, blog and website.
