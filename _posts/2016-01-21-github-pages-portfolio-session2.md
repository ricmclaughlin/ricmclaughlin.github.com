The focus of the second session of the Github Pages Portfolio Course is the installation of a ruby based tool chain, and the implementation of Jekyll for a portfolio website including blog posts and portfolio projects. This is a meaty class that is entirely hands on. By the end of the session, students have a great understanding of the ends and outs of Jekyll and have a fully functional github portfolio - just without projects that should be hosted in github. And we add those in session #3!

1. [Retrospectives on Session #1](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio2#/1)
