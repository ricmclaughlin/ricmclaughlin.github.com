Week 6 in the [M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101JS/about) class is all about the aggregation pipeline first built into MongoDB [version 2.1](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/16015854270/operations-in-the-new-aggregation-framework). At first I can't say I really understood why MongoDB had this feature.

Then I saw this page in the [MongoDB manual](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/)
