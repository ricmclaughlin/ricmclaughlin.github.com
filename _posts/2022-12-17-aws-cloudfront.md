[CloudFront](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) uses edge locations and regions as a CDN points of presence. Also protects against networking and application layer attack and integrates with Shield, WAF, &amp; Route53 while using HTTPS on requests and pull forwards. Support websockets.

# Origins
There are numerous content origins:
- _S3_ - S3 Website hosted must be enabled (?); use Origin Access Control (OAC) to restrict access to the bucket to CloudFront; can also be used as an ingress point for files into S3 
- _MediaStore Container &amp; MediaPackage Endpoint_ to deliver Video on Demand or live streaming video using AWS Media Services
- _Custom Origin (HTTP)_ including ALB/CLB, EC2 (with public IP), API Gateway, or any other HTTP endpoint. Three ways to deny direct origin access by clients: use SG to deny other access to these resources to any other actor than CloudFront using Origin Access Control (OAC); configure CloudFront &amp; origin to use a _Custom HTTP Header_ including a secret, OR restrict access to CloudFront public IP using a NACL/Firewall. 

## Origin Groups
To increase HA and do failover, create a primary and secondary origin in an _Origin Group_. Origin groups can span regions enabling cross-region HA.

# CloudFront Security
_Geo Restrictions_ - by default this is disabled; you can either allow or block by country; restricted viewers get a `403` and yes, you can create custom error pages.

Redirect HTTP to HTTPS is a common security feature which can be enable on Cloudfront.

## Access Control Content
Access control can be done using signed URLs or using signed Cookies using the Restrict Viewer Access option. This is done using a policy...

Use signed URLs for single downloads. Progressive Download can use a signed URL, user could use it to download the entire file which is sort of bad for some use cases. Use for marketing emails too.

Use signed cookies for progressive downloads, smooth streaming, or scenarios where you DON'T want the URL to change. Use for whole site authentication too.

### CloudFront Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL
CloudFront Signed URL give access to a path (no matter the origin), uses an account wide key-pair, can filter by IP, path, date, expiration, and use caching features. 

Use presigned S3 URLs when you aren't using CloudFront, uses the IAM principal of the signer, and has a limited lifetime.

## Pricing
To reduce cost, the number of edge location can be reduced using _Price Classes_. There are three price classes:
0. all regions - best performance
0. Class 200 - most regions, but excludes the expensive ones
0. Class 100 - only the least expensive ones

## Distributions
A Distribution is the name for the CDN you create - essentially a collection of Edge Locations. Three content types: static/dynamic web content, VOD content including Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) or Microsoft Smooth Streaming OR live event video. 

GET, HEAD, OPTIONS can be cached; PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE are not cached and do not invalidate objects in the cache

Custom origins and custom origin rules determine which part of website requests go where.

## Configuration 
CloudFront has many, many configuration options including:
* Device detection - Redirect or serve different content based on user agent
* CNAMEs - supports wildcard CNAMES and up to 100 CNAMES total
* Origin KeepAlive Timeout - keep connection from edge location to the CloudFront origin open
* Allowed HTTP Methods - can be just GET and HEAD
* Origin Protocol Policy - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS, HTTP, HTTPS or Match Viewer (use what ever protocol over the entire req/res); S3 DOES support HTTPS
* Custom Error pages - when the origin returns a 4XX or 5XX status code; has a min Error Caching TTL

### HTTPS
If the origin is S3 all requests are made to the distribution will stay the same protocol... so a request in HTTPS then it will be forwarded via HTTPS. Custom Origins can be configured to use HTTP only or to match viewer, which will match the user agent protocol.

There are three different ways to configure SSL (in order of goodness):
- Generic SSL Cert - using *.cloudfront.net SSL certificate
- SNI Custom SNL - included with CloudFront; multiple domains to serve SSL over same IP address; good support overall browsers; 
- Dedicated IP Custom SSL - expensive; limited support from ancient browsers

## Cloudfront Reports
[Cloudfront reporting](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/reports.html) uses logs data but does not require additional processing of the logs to get the good reporting sort of stuff. There are reports on caching metrics, popular objects, top referrers, and user agent information as well. 

CloudFront generates metrics to CloudWatch, CloudTrail and HTTP access logs. 

### Invalidation Technique Triage
- Slow, cheap, sucky invalidation? Delete origin file; wait for TTL to expire
- Fast, Expensive invalidation? Use Invalidation API to remove object from edge location
- Blue/green invalidation? Use Route53 Alias
- Build Process invalidation? Rename files

### Triage
- Support zone apex? - use Route53 to alias to CloudFront distribution
- Increase performance of your website? Increase cache hit percentage is the #1 way to increase CloudFront performance. Increasing min and max TTL helps improve this metric.
- Realtime metrics about website? monitor distribution with CloudWatch
- Increase HA? multiple distributions behind Route53
- Custom Error Message? from S3 with low TTL
- Zone apex? Use Route53 Alias records which are free instead of CNAME
- Uploading via CDN is faster but does not cache. 
- Same SSLÂ cert on CloudFront and ALB? Forward the host header
- Don't cache field on edge caches? Add `Cache-Control:no-cache="field-name"` header in responses

### Access Triage
- Restrict access to S3 content? origin access identity, which is a special CloudFront user with a bucket policy, give access to bucket, remove other access methods to bucket
- Restrict to Custom origin content? Custom headers in distribution, configure app to look for custom headers, Viewer protocol (force HTTPS from client), Origin Protocol (force HTTPS to origin)
- Need multiple Geo Restrictions? create multiple distributions
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS? use Viewer Protocol policy to force HTTPS

# Customization at the Edge
CloudFront has two different ways to change requests/responses at the edge: _CloudFront functions_ and _Lambda@Edge_. This customization enables request filtering, AuthZ/N, HTTP responses, Bot mitigation, and A/B testing. Can't use both Functions and Lambda@Edge on the viewer req/res at the same time.

## CloudFront Functions
Native feature of CloudFront deployed at the edge point of presence; modifies/transforms the viewer req/res; written in JavaScript; can scale to millions of TPS with less than 1ms access time; 1/6 the cost of Lambda@Edge; no access to the file system network. Use CloudFront Functions for:
- Cache Key normalization
- Header manipulation
- URL rewrites/redirects
- AuthZ/N

## Lambda@Edge
Deployed at regional edge cache; written in Python or Node.js in a VM with network and file system access; scales to 1000s of TPS; used to modify/transform the viewer req/res and origin req/res; author functions in us-east-1 then replicated to regional edge cache locations. Up to 5 seconds execution time on the view side and up to 30 seconds on the origin side. Use Lambda@Edge for:
- longer execution time
- more cpu
- access to AWS services
- access to request body (perhaps to load the right sized image based on the browser `User-Agent`)
- route request to load content to be cached from the closest origin (for example, load content from the closest bucket to the user into the closest edge location)
