HTML is NOT my favorite thing. Back in the day I made my first HTML app, I absolutely had no idea what HTML was or how to use it. I just copied stuff that worked and figured it out as I went along. And this is how most folks learned HTML back then. There were no books or websites available to teach you...

The bad news is that you can't do this anymore. Minified HTML and CSS combined with much more signifigant page complexity forces you to actually learn the HTML & CSS instead of hacking something together.

The good news is that you have tons of good resources from cheap to free that you can access to learn HTML 5 & CSS 3. Here is my recommendation on how to "update" or refresh your skills.

First, begin with the [codecademy HTML/CSS class](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web). Over 4 million folks have taken this free class in the comfort of their own browser. A good place to start.

Second, work through a couple o' HTML project in your browser. Again, the codecedmy prepare to spend a bit of money. 

The first couple of courses are in your browser and that is nice for total newbies. But we aren't newbies. Please do both above courses using a text editor and the emmet plugin.

From here prepare to spend a tiny bit of money. Udemy
