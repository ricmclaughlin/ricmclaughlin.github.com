One of the first really good Ruby activities I did was Ruby Koans. This is a highly recommended learning tool from beginner to master level Rubyists. Here is the rundown:

**What is it?** A super cool way of learning Ruby by doing thought provoking exercises seasoned with a dash of TDD.

**Who is it for?** You would need to be familiar with the command line and have at least some programming background. Some familiarity with TDD will help. No Ruby knowledge is required.

**Breadth of Instruction:** Not every single element of Ruby is covered but most basic things like variable types, iteration, hashes, blocks, exception handling and a few advanced things like Java interop. A bit more than just the basics.

**Depth of instruction:** This is skill building material. You have to edit files. Do projects on your own. Although I’m far from a ruby master I suspect there is enough depth in this material that even a master level folk would get a couple of gems.

**Value:** Off the chart. Costs nothing but time.

**Cost:** Free

**Setup:** Ruby > 1.8 and text editor

**Recommendation:** Download the koans and dig in.
