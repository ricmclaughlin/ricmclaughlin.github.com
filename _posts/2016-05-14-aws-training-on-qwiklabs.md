If you want to get a broad overview of AWS technologies for free, I am going to recommend [qwikLABS](https://qwiklabs.com). They have tons of free labs, on almost every single technology from AWS and they have tons of paid classes too. I took these classes while preparing for the [AWS Certified Developer - Associate ](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) exam and they were quite useful.

I took a couple of free labs along the way too. I've noted those with bling.
