#Session 1 Homework

The goal is to use the same process we used to create the first_one project and create a new project. 

There isn’t anything in this homework we haven’t covered and if you have problems you call refer to the live presentation and modify as needed. Email me if you are having problems.

##Create a new website project

1. Create a new repo on github called second_one

2. Create a second_one c9 workspace and clone second_one into that workspace

2. In a git feature branch create index.html file

2. Add some HTML of your choosing to index.html

2. In the c9 browser tab preview your changes

2. Merge your feature branch to master

2. Push your changes to github

2. Create a gh-pages branch and push the gh-pages branch to origin

2. Confirm you your new project is live at at https://[github username].github.io/second_one

##Add a link to second_one from your portfolio
