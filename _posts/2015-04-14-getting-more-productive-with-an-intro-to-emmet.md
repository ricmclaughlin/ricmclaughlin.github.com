I've never spent too much time working on file editing productivity...I learned the [Common User Access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access) stuff about 1.5 million years ago but after spending more time that I would like editing HTML, well, I'm ready to type less and do more.

My editor of choice is [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and I have done some light package pimping for Ruby/Rails but nothing really for HTML. [Emmet](http://www.emmet.io) has always been interesting so I installed it.

And it looks very cool. Then I went over to Udemy and took the free class at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/) titled [Faster HTML & CSS workflow with Emmet + Bootstrap](https://www.udemy.com/emmet-video-tutorials/)

Then I invested an hour reading through the [docs](http://docs.emmet.io/) and watching the videos.

Now the HTML just flows from my hands like a crystal clear stream descending from the heavens or something like that.
