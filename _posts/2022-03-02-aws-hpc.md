High Performance computing needs lots of data movement, storage, compute and networking, as well as orchestration and automation.

## Data Transfer
- Snowball, Snowmobile
- AWS DataSync
- Direct Connect

## Storage
- Instance attached - EBS io2, instance storage
- Network storage - S3, EFS, 
- FSx for Lustre

## Compute and networking
- GPU optimized instances
- EC2 fleets (spot instances and/or spot fleets)
- Placement groups as documented on this EC2 deep dive page.
- Enhanced networking - includes higher bandwidth, higher PPS, lower latency. This can be achieved using elastic network adapters OR the legacy Intel 82599 VF specification.
- Elastic fabric adapter - uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard to bypass Linux OS.

## orchestration and automation
- Batch
- AWS ParallelCluster - an open source orchestraction tool that uses text file instead of CloudFormation.
