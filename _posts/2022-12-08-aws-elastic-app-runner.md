# App Runner
[App Runner)](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) is the container management service that supports [Docker](https://aws.amazon.com/docker/) containers on Fargate using a simplified interface - this is sort of like Elastic Beanstalk but... well... better. 

App Runner enables you to build from source (Python, Node.js, Java) or simply use an image. Images can't be loaded from a different region.
