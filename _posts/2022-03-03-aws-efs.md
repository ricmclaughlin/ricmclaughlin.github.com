# EFS
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, serverless, set-and-forget elastic file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth. 

Amazon EFS has a simple web services interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. The service manages all the file storage infrastructure for you, meaning that you can avoid the complexity of deploying, patching, and maintaining complex file system configurations. EFS is restricted to one VPC at a time; VPC peering does work. EFS uses port 2049; add a mount target to more than one AZ.

EFS has ~~two~~ four classes of storage: standard and standard-I AND EFS one zone and EFS one-zone IA. One zone is good for big data, media processing, content management, web serving or home directories that don't require multi-AZ.

EFS has two performance modes, which can't be changed after creation: general performance & Max I/O (20-1000s of EC2 with increased latency).

EFS has two throughput modes: Bursting & Provisioned throughput modes

Data can be encrypted at file system creation and encryption in transit is set when you mount the file system. Access can be controlled via IAM & security groups. EFS Mount helper, a recommend approach for mounting EFS, uses TLS.

Data can be replicated using EFS Cross-region replication.
