For any curriculum, in the first session after laying out the learning objectives and agenda for the course for the students, my approach is start with a super clear discussion of the problem we are looking to solve with the technology we are learning. This helps focus everyone on WHEN to apply this technology and techniques  lots of why & what, architecture, best practices, workflow, hands-on with a "we do, you do, you extend" model. And even in such a short course, this is doable but requires super tight focus on teaching NOTHING not specifically included in the learning objectives. 


By focusing on the full spectrum of thinking skills even when most instructors only teach the knowledge and ccurri, I've found students learn a subject more completely





To get a feel for how I work and quality of my work, here is an outline of how I developed, taught, gathered feedback then iteratively improved the course.

## Step 1: High Level Learning Objectives

As in almost all curriculum development projects, I started with the end in mind: what will the student learn as a result of the curriculum being developed. I format those results in the form of the learning objectives using words 

Initially, after a brief chat with my colleagues, a brief read through of the AWS IoT doc and lots of experience getting folks started with AWS, I came up with a list of learning objectives that looked something like:


## Step 2: Learning Module Development

Lower level LO
Problem; what why, alternatives
Hands-on walk through; building a checklist along the way
Check for understanding
Evaluate result; Iteratively improve the result of what we just did??
Segway to the next topic
Present chances for extention and additional learning 


They needed to understand how to create a secure AWS account and yes, that includes setting up MFS. 

struggle with the board; overhead of creating a secure AWS account; annoying interface with DynamoDB; Finishing vs perfect = cheese is required sometimes

## Step 3: Deliver and Evaluate Student Outcomes

The difficulty of monologing & hybrid live student
No ability to gather student direct student feedback... and this was a missed opportunity on my part; got student via onsite instructor

## Step 0 or Step 4?... not sure...

The IoT device as an event source = AWS IoT button
More formal checks for understanding
LMS implementation with a self paced option
