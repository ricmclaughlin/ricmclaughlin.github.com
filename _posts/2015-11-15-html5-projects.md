<h2 id="projects-in-html5">Projects in HTML5</h2>
<p>Tons of projects in the Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-html5/learn/#/">Projects in HTML5</a> course. Tons of cheese in there tooâ€¦ bad code formatting. Bad Boston accent. Clearly the instructor is a reformed php hack. But hey, we all come from somewhere.</p>
