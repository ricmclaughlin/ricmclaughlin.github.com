I've been spending some time working with TDD and angular. Lots of stuff to do on this. So I developed a very simple angular.js app with a super simple [express](http://expressjs.com/en/)  bunch of TDD tools including [chai](http://chaijs.com/), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) and [instanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/).

Overall, this was a pretty fun little app. In the future, I'd look to use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) instead of chat and mocha because the jasmine is more complete... which leads to easier testing. I scaffolded this project myself using gulp. Nothing amazing to look at but quite well tested.
