So, I was jazzed about Ember.js. But the tooling, or more specifically the lack of tooling, is a bit on an issue. Ember-cli is a nice step in the right direction. But it isn't cooked. 

Oh, and Ember data isn't cooked either. I'd love to use emberjs but man it is rough to both learn something all new and combat poor documentation, tooling and product 

That is NOT to say I don't think emberjs has a future. I think it does. But with the slow development of ember-cli and ember data it isn't going to be my future.

The end result of emberjs was a bit of a flame out. I was nearing the end of my juice after 8 months of pretty solid learning.... or at least studying. Did the PMI-ACP certification, a HTML/CSS brush up and went hard on rails. Felt pretty good with the learning. 

But the life, and a bad run of luck with ember, took over. But I'm back.
