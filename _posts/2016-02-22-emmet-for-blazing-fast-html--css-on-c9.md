This is a single evening hour-ish long course that introduces students to how they will progress from coding in a browser to a professional environment, how c9 fits into the progression and then ultimately introduces folks to the power of emmet in the c9 environment. 

I first taught this class February 23, 2016 at the Free Code Camp - Ballard meetup.
