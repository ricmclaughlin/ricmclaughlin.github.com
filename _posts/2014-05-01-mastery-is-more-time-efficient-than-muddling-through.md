When faced with a new, non-trival thing to do, I used to think... "hum, I can ~~just~~ read a bit or Google some sample work and make it happen." And sure, that approach will work for smaller things. But, and this is a big but, this almost never works in practice. 

My most recent and probably most painful proof point on this topic was a project I did for a client a couple of years ago. The job was very straightforward with easy to understand requirements. Rewrite an existing web app from ASP classic to ASP.NET. I got to pick the technical architecture and I figured... well, how different can .NET be from ASP? Oh, and I'll make the entire thing be completely Ajax because that is cool and I'll make it run on MS Entity Framework V1 because why mess with SQL? And isn't C# just like C++ and Java - stuff I know well?

No need to make a sample app, read the documentation or anything rational. I've been doing this too long for silliness like that. I'll just do it.

Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

So what did I learn? Some things I already knew but just ignored. Like don't use any technology until version 3. Do a test app on any technology you don't completely understand the nature of.

But most importantly, I learned that even though it might seem like learning as you go is the easist way to get something new done - but it just isn't. At a minimium before you kick off a new activity on a new technology you should develop some **mastery** of the subject prior to doing it on a project. I think of it as a Learning Spike.
