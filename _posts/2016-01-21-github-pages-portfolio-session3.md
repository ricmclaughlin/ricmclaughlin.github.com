The focus of the third session of the Github Pages Portfolio Course is the installation of a node based tool chain, the use of yeoman to scaffold projects and the use of the [gulp-gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages) gulp plugin to deploy the website to gh-pages. There is a bit of review for some workflow sections of session 1 and session 2 where students create a new git project from scratch and create a Jekyll blog post from scratch. Like session 1 and session 2 of this class this class that is entirely hands on. By the end of the session, students have a great understanding of the ends and outs of Jekyll and have a fully functional github portfolio including projects source code AND live projects hosted there as well. 

The big thing I hope students get out of this is basic git workflow, the identification of tool chain patterns (all tool chains have package managers, task runners, etc) and the ability to navigate new technologies based on these patterns. The initial response to the class has been really good and I look forward to teaching it again and helping out my fellow [Free Code Campers!](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
