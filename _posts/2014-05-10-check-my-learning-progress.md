Since the first of the year, and after I got my [PMI-ACP certification](http://www.pmi.org/en/Certification/New-PMI-Agile-Certification.aspx “Title”), I have been doing a lot of professional development on the web development side. The overall goal is to be able to pull off a nontrivial web app that runs across all client platforms developed in MV* javascript framework (obviously using HTML5/CSS), with an API based [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ “Title”) hosted in the cloud. 

I have taken a sh*t ton of online courses. Here is my profile on those sites:

[Ric McLaughlin on Codecademy]( http://www.codecademy.com/ricmclaughlin “Title”)

[Ric McLaughlin code school report card](https://www.codeschool.com/users/368900 “Title”)

What is my plan to swallow each of these technical elephants? Keep at and take a bit every day. Here is my detailed plan by track:

* [Ruby](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/the-ruby-learning-path/ "Title") 
* Rails
* HTML5/CSS
* MV*
* Javacript/jQuery
* DevOps
* UI Design
