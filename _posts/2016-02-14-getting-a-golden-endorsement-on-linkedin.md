Everyone that has seen LinkedIn has seen [recommendations](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/90/kw/recommendations). But skill endorsements don't seem to hold the [same passion or impact](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/33125/ft/eng). I'm trying to build up a bunch myself... just because. Why would I do this? And if I do this should you?

So first, you are asking, what is an [LinkedIn endorsement](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/31888/~/skill-endorsements---overview)? Technically it is called a skills endorsement and it is a handy way to draw attention to the skills you have and allow other connections to say "yeah, they can do that" that for any skill you choose to list. This could work for you a number of ways.

Say, you are a software developer and the hot new thing is git. It stands to reason if you add the "git" skill to your LinkedIn profile and got 200 of your connections to endorse your hot new skill folks might think you know something about git. The more endorsements ya got, the better you look.

And that is the whole idea. [Add a skill](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35265/ft/eng) to your LinkedIn profile. Get folks that matter, and those folks are your connections, to endorse it and you look better on paper. Or in this case on LinkedIn. Lots of folks [agree](https://www.themuse.com/advice/linkedin-endorsements-how-to-get-the-ones-that-really-matter).
