<p>In the interest of making a website out of a book I didn’t write and don’t want to exactly copy, I did all the exercises in the best AngularJS book I could find. And that book is  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured-ebook/dp/B00NF07FSC">AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps</a> by Shyam Seshadri &amp; Brad Green. I really like the emphasis on testing, structure and the clear instruction they have going on. This book doesn’t use a build stack so I used yo/grunt/bower because that is easy to <a href="http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html">figure out</a>. My version of this book (<a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/ngup_n_running/">AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps</a>) includes notes and as much of the code as could be fit in. I did this project with the yeoman <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular">angular/grunt</a> generator.</p>
