<p>In the interest of making a website out of a book I didn’t write and don’t want to exactly copy, I did all the exercises in the best AngularJS book I could find  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Running-Enhanced-Productivity-Structured-ebook/dp/B00NF07FSC">AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps</a> by Shyam Seshadri &amp; Brad Green. I really like the emphasis on testing, structure and the clear instruction they have going on. Doesn’t use yo/grunt/bower but that is easy to <a href="http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html">figure out</a>. My walkthrough of <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/ngup_n_running/">AngularJS: Up and Running: Enhanced Productivity with Structured Web Apps</a> includes notes and as much of the code as could be fit in. I did this project with the yeoman <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular">angular/grunt</a> generator.  </p>
