The idea behind the class is to take students who have a basic compentence in HTML & CSS with bit of commandline and JavaScript skills and teach them the basics of [git](https://git-scm.com/), [github](https://github.com/ricmclaughlin), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). In addition, folks will get some understanding of what a development tool chain is and how to manage that tool chain on an [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) workstation using the super cool [c9](https://c9.io) cloud development environment.

At the end of the class folks will have a basic understanding of git and git workflow, github and github pages, a bit of bash shell, Jekyll and the ruby toolchain, Yeomand/Gulpjs and the nodejs toolchain, a portfolio website with a blog and excellent management tools. The website you make in this class should enable you to showcase your projects and the code behind those projects for anyone interested in HIRING you as a professional software developer. Plus all your friends will be amazed!
