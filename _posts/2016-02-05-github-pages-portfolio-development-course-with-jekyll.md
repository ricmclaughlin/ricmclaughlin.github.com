The idea behind the class is to take students who have a basic compentence in HTML & CSS with bit of commandline and JavaScript skills and teach them the basics of [git](https://git-scm.com/), [github](https://github.com/ricmclaughlin), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). In addition, students get some understanding of what a development tool chain is and how to manage that tool chain on an [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) workstation using the super cool [c9](https://c9.io) cloud development environment. 

Checkout the detailed curriculum that I developed for Free Code Camp - Ballard:

Github Pages Portfolio Development <a href={{ BASE_PATH }}"/projects/github-pages-portfolio-session1">Session 1</a>

Github Pages Portfolio Development <a href={{ BASE_PATH }}"/projects/github-pages-portfolio-session2">Session 2</a>

Github Pages Portfolio Development <a href={{ BASE_PATH }}"/projects/github-pages-portfolio-session3">Session 3</a>

This class uses [c9](https://c9.io) and here are the [setup instructions](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/posts/github-pages-portfolio-class-setup-with-c9).
