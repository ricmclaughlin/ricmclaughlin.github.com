I've been involved with the Free Code Camp group here in Seattle for the last several months and I have gotten so much from the energy and enthuisasm of it.

In the midst of that enthuisasm I have noticed that FCC, and almost no one I can find, teaches folks how to make an online portfolio and certainly not using [jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/). Combined with the troubles lots of folks have taking coding skill they have learned in a browser and applying them to the desktop you have the makings of a great class.

This is my opportunity to give back to the group. 

The entire class is conducted in a hands on manner - at the end of the class everyone will have made their own online portfolio, hosted on github using the Jekyll static site generator, complete with a blog and knowledge of the Ruby and NodeJS toolchains, git/github, a bit of experience on the command line, a bit about gulpjs and the ability to create new projects and host the source and completed website on github as well. This is a jam packed course.

To make things easier, the class uses the free c9 service that Free Code Camp uses in their curriculum. Folks taking the class should setup a git hub account, a c9 account and create their new workspace for the class. I have made instructions on how to do that on . 

The first session covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to the importance of an [online portfolio](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/5) - Hint: Show hiring managers that you can code.

4. An introduction to the [C9 development environment](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/13)

2. Introduction to [git and github](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/15) - What is git and github and why are they so important.

4. How github gives us the goodness of [open source software](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/17) and how to `clone` and `fork` a repo.

5. How git gives us the power to [screw up](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/22) and how to `checkout` and `commit`.

6. How githubs enables [offsite backup](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/24) and how to `push` and `pull`

6. How git gives us the [freedom to experiment](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/31) how to `branch` and `merge` and why we do these activities in a developer workflow.

5. Git hub profile and a [personal gh-pages](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/25) website - How to host a website on github.

6. [Gh-pages for projects](http://slides.com/ricmclaughlin/githubportfolio1-1-5-8/#/43) - How we can use gh-pages for projects to host our projects.
