The advanced ruby stuff is pretty hard... and literally very meta. I might recommend the [Ruby Monk Metaprogramming Ruby: Ascent](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/5-metaprogramming-ruby-ascent) which is a mighty long name for a pretty rough course. This course does NOT implement HTTPS so chrome gets annoyed. Seems safe to me... and if someone looks in on you learning ruby, well, isn't that good?

If this resource feels to meta for you, I'd recommend starting with the [Beginner path]({{ BASE_PATH }}/posts/the-ruby-learning-path-beginner) if you havenâ€™t programmed before, need a programming refresher or would just like to start with easier material before getting to the harder stuff. 

OR

Start at the [Intermediate path]({{ BASE_PATH }}/posts/the-ruby-learning-path-intermediate) if you have programmed before and feel confident with install Ruby and a code editor. 

Lots of other good resources around! Good Luck!
