There are several different deployment models and tools to implement those models... 

One important way to classify deployments is in-place, where instances are upgraded, or disposable, where instances are treated as immutable and new instances are created and old instances are destroyed. 

Another way to classify deployments is bootstraping, where code is installed to a running instance at launch, versus pre-baking where the application is loaded on the image. 

# Deployment types

There are numerous different types of deployments including all instances at one time, rolling, immutable environment, and blue/green. 

## All at Once

In this scenario, all instances at one time regardless of how many instances there are..
    
 * Downtime: yes

 * Failed deployment: downtime

 * DNS: no change

 * Speed: fast

Scenario -> Product 

## Rolling Deployment

In a Rolling Deployment deployment only some instances at a time are upgraded in place. In many scenarios, a minimium number of instances stays in service.

* Downtime: none

* Failed Deployment: Rollback affected instances

* DNS: none

* Speed: longer

## Immutable Environment

An Immutable Environment deployment is similiar to a Rolling deployment except with new resources. For instance two autoscaling groups would be used.

* Downtime: None

* Failed Deployment: Rollback new resources; slow

* DNS: none

* Speed: longer; costs more

## Blue-Green

In a Blue-Green deployment a new identical environment is created then tested and something, perhaps DNS or other networking setting is changed to send the new environment live. The Blue environment is the live environment; the green environment is new, not-yet-live version. Works best when implemented on loosely coupled applications; doesn't work well when schema is tightly couple to application, deployment aware application using feature flags, or is COTS app that isn't blue/green friendly.

* Downtime: None

* Failed Deployment: The fastest; simply change networking configuration back

* DNS: Yes, sometimes; this can be a disadvantage because of DNS caching

* Speed: longer; costs more

A/B testing or canary testing is a variation where a portion of traffic is sent to the green environment to test it out. A/B might not be for deployment; it might be just for testing. 

### Blue-Green Implementation

* Update DNS Routing - works well for single instance, or an ELB in conjunction with ASG, ECS or EB; DNS changes are problematic; ELB prewarming may be required; higher costs because of two concurrent online systems during deployment

* Swap ASG behind ELB - startup new ASG; canary test green systems; put some blue instances in `StandBy` Don't wanna mess with DNS; very fast rollback with no DNS change; swapping ECS Service behind ELB is a similiar idea

* Swap Launch Config in ASG - Update launch config; double ASG Size; put old config in standby; OK? reduce ASG size terminating old configuration first (Barely blue/green);  difficult canary analysis -> hard to detect errors with two launch configs in play and schema changes must be independent of app changes (ideally); switching ECS Task definitions is a similiar idea

* Swap EB Environments - Create new environment with a new version; Do a "Swap Environment URL"

* Clone OpsWorks Stack - Clone stack; deploy version using `Deploy` command; change DNS

Schema change is a giant problem with blue/green deployment; decoupling the schema change from the code change which can be be implemented as schema change first or schema change last. Schema change first is preferred because rolling back a schema change in production is a high risk manuveur. 

Schema change can also be handled by creating a centralized write process either through a queue used for writes during the deployment OR the green environment writes to both databases OR each environment writes to there own DB and uses an async process to syncronize the data.

## Triage

In-place deployments are traditional method of application deployment but are hard to rollback and deployment causes downtime so it is hard to have time to debug a problem with the new version. In-place deployments are generally faster, good or maybe better for session-less apps and ideal for OpsWorks or Puppet. 

Disposable is generally slower because new instances must be created and tools that have great support for Green/Blue deployments like Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation are better DevOps tool choices.

### Product Strengths and Weaknesses

* EB - fastest and simpliest way to deploy code; Beanstalk doesnâ€™t allow as much flexibility for some configurations and deployments and is more suitable for shorter application lifecycles where an environment can be thrown away with each deploy. 

* Opsworks - more focused on application management; can't do rolling batch with Opsworks...

* Cloudformation - control

### Scenario -> Product

maintain capacity; Speed not issue = rolling with batch ; Opsworks? Cloudformation

in-place? Opsworks &amp; CodeDeploy

Super fast? in-place; all-at-once faster than rolling

Consistent or lots of deployments? in-place

No DNS change? all-at-once, rolling, immutable, blue/green with launch config change OR ASG swap

No downtime? Blue/Green

Pre-baked AMI? Cloudformation &amp; OpsWorks

Canary Analysis = Route53; not well supported with Elastic Beanstalk

### Hybrid Deployment Models

Use CloudFormation to deploy EB apps

Use CloudFormation to deploy OpsWorks stacks
