I’m having one of those “this has got the be the next big thing” feelings about [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/ "title") right now. 

Ember.js feels so much like [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ ) did 5 years ago.. remember when you first saw rails and said “Wow, I am doing so much less coding to get this working, it is freaky. and the although the code has a ‘black magic’ feel to it, I am diggin’t it!”

So I am learning it… first up is running through the [getting started](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/ “title”) on the emberjs.com site.

Here is my version of the [ember todo app](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/projects/ember_todo_MVC/)

Next up? not sure yet.
