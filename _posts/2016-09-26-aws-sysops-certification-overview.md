With my ongoing saga of AWS Certification, next up is the [AWS SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/). This is comfortably within my skillset, yet a deep dive in RDS, and OpsWorks, is mostly new from a technical perspective even though the concepts behind these technologies have been around a while. 

These articles are a collection of my notes by section. They may, or may not be, useful for you. For each chunky topic, I'll capture the big facts and stuff I had to remind myself to remember.

I pass the AWS SysOps Administrator Associate certification Oct 21, 2016:
