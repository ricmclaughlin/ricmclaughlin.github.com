The [AWS Management Portal for vCenter](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/vcenter-portal/) is a plug-in for vCenter than makes the migration from VMware instances to EC2 instances quite easy.

There are several use cases for this tool including: 

- Migration from VMware instances to EC2 instances

- Reach new geographies from vCenter (DR in a different region)

- Self-service AWS Portal - enable sysadmins and devs the ability to create instances from within a fimiliar interface

- Leverage vCenter experience while getting stated with AWS
