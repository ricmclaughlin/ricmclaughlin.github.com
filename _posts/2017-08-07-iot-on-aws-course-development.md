Perhaps my favorite curriculum development project to date was "IoT on AWS" a course I developed for [Level Education](https://www.leveledu.com/) initially offered as part of their [IoT bootcamp](https://pages.northeastern.edu/IoT.html program. To get a feel for how I work and quality of my work, here is an outline of how I developed, taught, gathered feedback then iteratively improved the course.

The high level educational goal of the course is to teach IoT students that are tech savvy and hardware focused enough of the AWS IoT service to get started on their own... in two 3-hours sessions. The course clearly had to include lots of the "what and why" of AWS IoT, a good definitional desciption of numerous system components and how they fit together, one or more hands-on activities that included hooking up a device to the AWS service and a good overview of what other sorts of problems the student to look to solve with AWS IoT. That's ambitious. And challenging. And would make a great course if I could pull it off. 

## Step 1: High Level Learning Objectives

As in almost all curriculum development projects, I started with the end in mind: what will the student learn as a result of the curriculum being developed. I format those results in the form of the learning objectives using words 

Initially, after a brief chat with my colleagues, a brief read through of the AWS IoT doc and lots of experience getting folks started with AWS, I came up with a list of learning objectives that looked something like:


## Step 2: Learning Module Development

Lower level LO
Problem; what why, alternatives
Hands-on walk through; building a checklist along the way
Check for understanding
Evaluate result; Iteratively improve the result of what we just did??
Segway to the next topic
Present chances for extention and additional learning 


They needed to understand how to create a secure AWS account and yes, that includes setting up MFS. 

struggle with the board; overhead of creating a secure AWS account; annoying interface with DynamoDB; Finishing vs perfect = cheese is required sometimes

## Step 3: Deliver and Evaluate Student Outcomes

The difficulty of monologing & hybrid live student
No ability to gather student direct student feedback... and this was a missed opportunity on my part; got student via onsite instructor

## Step 0 or Step 4?... not sure...

The IoT device as an event source = AWS IoT button
More formal checks for understanding
LMS implementation with a self paced option










My development process
Start with the end Learning objectives in mind

Don't over think v1 then iterate

Hands-on exercises with resusable workflow guides

Higher order thinking skills
