{% include JB/setup %}

If you are getting ready to complete the Github Pages Portfolio Class this is the setup you need to do prior to getting to class:

1. Go to [github](https://github.com/) and create an account if you don't have one already. Github is the epicenter of open source software and a great place to create your new online portfolio - for free!
2. Now head over to [c9](https://c9.io) and create an account - signup using your github account. c9 is a coding environment in the cloud. When using c9 you access a virtual Ubuntu Linux server in the c9 data center which includes a nice editor and great integration to services like github. You will use c9 later in the Free Code Camp courseware - we are getting a head start!
3. Once signup is complete and you have given them your email address, you will be presented a screen that says "Workspaces." Click on "Create a new workspace" then fill in the "workspace name" with "portfolio", then in the "choose a template" section click on the "Custom" template and finally click on "Create workspace".
4. From here c9 will create you a new workspace called "portfolio." We will use this workspace during the class to do all our development. 

Let email me when you complete this task or if you need a bit of help getting setup!
