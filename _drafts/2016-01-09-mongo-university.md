<p>I've been interested in MongoDB for a while. In fact, I have started, but not finished the <a href="https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101J/about">M101P: MongoDB for developers class</a> twice now.</p> 

<p>And both times I have gotten close the end but ran into outside pressures that made it difficult to complete. Well, this time I am firmly committed to finishing the class. The best part is that this class is not only free, it has been updated to use the new 3.2 version of MongoDB.</p>

<p>Look for more MongoDB goodness from me in the future!</p>
