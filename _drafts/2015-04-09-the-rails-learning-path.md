Sure, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is used by [sysadmins](http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.de/2011/09/how-ruby-is-beating-python-in-battle.html), [devops](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) and even by [newbie programmer](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) but the biggest group of folks using Ruby is for [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). And although there is some rumbling about how Rails is [loosing steam](http://developers.slashdot.org/story/14/11/26/158223/is-ruby-on-rails-losing-steam) that has not stopped lots of folks to learning it.

But I proceed with caution about learning anything new... learning is time consuming so if you want to learn rails... well, you should be sure about it. To that end, I'd recommend getting your feed wet with Rails, learn Ruby completely, then complete learning Rails.  

I should also say that while a giant expensive courses to learn Rails might seem necessary, I have done a lot of professional software development with no training, with free training or with course that cost less than $200 dollars. 

That said, I'd recommend these courses in this order:

First, follow my [The Ruby Learning Path - Beginner Level](posts/the-ruby-learning-path-beginner) set of courses or the [The Ruby Learning Path - Intermediate Level](the-ruby-learning-path-intermediate/ "Title") if you have programmed before. 

Up next is the [Ruby on Rails:Level I](https://pragmaticstudio.com/rails) course. The thing I really like about this class is the format. Watch a video. Do some exercises that require you to think. Do some bonus material. THEN create another app on your own that is similar enough to the example so that you know what you are doing but different enough to make you think. A little weak on the testing side but has crystal clear material with a superior format. A deal at $169. Should take a couple of weeks to soak it all in.

After this I did the [Ruby on Rails:Level II](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/rails-iis) class. Not quite as strong as the Level I class but you get a deal on the class because you are an alumni and the same great learning format carries over to this class. These classes are the gold standard of Rails learning online.

From here, you are ready to do something real. I completed these courses in 2014 [Ruby on Rails: Level I & II](https://pragmaticstudio.com/alumni/ric-mclaughlin-kj1q)
