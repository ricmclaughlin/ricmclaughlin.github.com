Ok, so I haven't done a rails app since I learned rails for the second time a couple of years ago. Turns out nothing much has change with rails since I last looked at it - I am pretty sure that was using version 3.2 as I remember.

So this little app is nothing more than a scaffold, with a couple of models and some very basic boiler plate. That said, I do remember why like rails better than node. Ruby is so much easier to read and the projects are so much more rationally organized. Too bad you can't write some sort of ruby syntax to generate JavaScript. 

This project is part of my portfolio... just don't expect much from this [project](https://github.com/ricmclaughlin/rails_basic_blog).
