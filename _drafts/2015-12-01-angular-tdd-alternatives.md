<h2 class="lesshead" id="tdd-with-angularjs">TDD with AngularJS</h2>
<p>This project was the first one I have done with TDD. Nothing amazing but a good look into the logistics of getting a complete TDD stack going. Includes a bunch of TDD tools including <a href="http://chaijs.com/">chai</a>, <a href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a>, <a href="https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/">protractor</a> and <a href="https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/">instanbul</a>. I do like chai a lot and its support of BDD and the really nice chainable style matchers. 

<p>Protractor and webdriver got implemented too. Looking forward to digging into this part of Angular testing more in the future.</p>
