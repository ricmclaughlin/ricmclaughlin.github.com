Getting started with flex as a layout tool is easy - create a flex container - using `display` 
`css
.container {
  display: flex;
  /* By default flex uses rows, and puts items left to right: */
  flex-direction: row;
  /* By default flex does NOT wrap: */
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
}
`

flex direction

flex wrap - 

flex order: flawed - item selection in the browser window is screwy - and this is my thing to do as I browse - I love selecting text in a brower window as I read it. 

justify-content - applied to the container
  flex-begin - default
  flex-end - 
  center
  space-between 
  space-around
