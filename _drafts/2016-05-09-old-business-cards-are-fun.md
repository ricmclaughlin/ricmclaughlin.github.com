  <p>After I graduated from UTD Business School at ended, I <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/softwarehouse.jpg">sold computers</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA#History">Soft Warehouse</a>, a small shop that later became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA">CompUSA</a>, back you needed to go to the store to buy stuff.</p>
  <p>Then somehow I got hired at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act!_CRM#History">Contact Software</a>, probably because I sold a ton of ACT! at Soft Warehouse and I had once seen a mac, where I <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/act.jpg">found bugs</a> in ACT! DOS V1.1. After <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SYMANTEC+ACQUIRES+CONTACT+SOFTWARE+INTERNATIONAL%3B+ESTABLISHES+CONTACT...-a013148513">we got bought</a> by Symantec and I started developing and <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/symantecscm.jpg">built ACT!</a> for Windows, and ACT! for Mac and ACT! for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_95LX">HP 95LX</a>, and even <a href="http://http://www.symantec.com/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=19960108_03">ACT!</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform">Apple Newton</a>). Then I got promoted and <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/symanteccoretech.jpg">ran a dev group</a> at Symantec. The ACT! product is still around... except it is <a href="http://www.act.com/">act!</a> now.</p>
  <p>After a move to Austin, I tried to get some <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/smartdec.jpg">development</a> going but ended up I growing a couple of random guys into a really <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/smartconsult.jpg">big consulting group</a> at <a href="http://smartdna.com/">SMART Technologies</a>. No, not that <a href="https://smarttech.com/Home+Page/Landing+Page">SMART technologies</a>. The one that got <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/i2-nabs-smart-technologies/smart">acquired by i2</a>.</p>
  <h2>That seems rational. What happened then?</h2>
  <p>I went all irrational. I <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/idot.png">built a team</a> to build a configure-to-order computer e-commerce site... called <a href="http://idot.com/">idot.com</a> in <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1999/10/18/focus5.html">Dell's shadow</a>. The site was <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idotcom-wins-accolades-for-ultra-cool-shopping-site-78043117.html">award winning</a> so we totally were going to get big, right! Nope, we went broke. And I didn't make a cent when they <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1999/12/06/story8.html">acquired</a>  the website.</p><p>After that, even as the Internet bubble was inflating, I had to party like it was 1999, cause it was, and I had a great name for a new company: <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/hcbuscard.png">Holistic Commerce</a>. So I made a neat little <a href="/assets/themes/ricify/images/hclogo.png">brand</a> and started raising money. But the whole thing turned into a walking, breathing, <a href="http://blog.simeonov.com/startup-anti-patterns/">Lean startup anti-pattern (#35)</a>. Thankfully, when the time came to take the money, I didn't.</p>
  <h2>That sound irrational all right. Did the irrationality continue?</h2>
  <p>No, it didn't. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">bubble popped</a>, I found shelter and smooshed the web development, Internet marketing and customer data warehouse of several <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/mission-critical-and-netiq-merge-in-1-42-billion-deal/">new merged companies</a> (<a href="http://www.webtrends.com/">Webtrends</a>, <a href="https://www.netiq.com/">NetIQ</a> and <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/mission-critical-software-inc-7686-4447">Mission Critical</a>) into a functioning team. It actually worked.</p><p>But that was all too easy. I needed something harder. Perhaps I should get married, quit my job and be a stay-at-home-dad. No, that isn't hard enough, I should be a <a href="http://www.bavarianintlprep.com">homeschooling stay-at-home-dad</a> and move all over the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ric.mclaughlin1/map">world</a>.</p>
